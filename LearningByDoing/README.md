## Overview

This folder contains my **hands-on exploration** of Spring Boot framework and REST API development. Through multiple practice projects, I've been learning and implementing various aspects of modern web API development with Spring Boot.

## Learning Journey

### ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**
Exploring Spring Boot ecosystem and mastering REST API development through practical implementation.

### ðŸ“š **What I'm Learning**
- **Spring Boot Framework**: Application structure, configuration, and best practices
- **REST API Design**: HTTP methods, proper endpoint design, and API conventions  
- **Database Integration**: JPA with MySQL for data persistence
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality
- **API Testing**: Using Postman for endpoint testing and validation

## Projects Structure

### ðŸ“– **Book Management API** (`/book`)
- **Status**: **Successfully Completed**
- **Achievement**: **Full CRUD operations working with Postman**
- **Features**:
  - Complete book management system
  - All REST endpoints functional
  - MySQL database integration
  - Successful API testing via Postman

## Key Achievements

### **Successful CRUD Implementation**
- **CREATE**: POST endpoints for adding new resources
- **READ**: GET endpoints for retrieving data (single & multiple records)
- **UPDATE**: PUT/PATCH endpoints for modifying existing data  
- **DELETE**: DELETE endpoints for removing resources

### **API Testing Mastery**
- Successfully tested all endpoints using **Postman**
- Verified request/response formats
- Validated HTTP status codes
- Confirmed database operations

### **Database Integration**
- MySQL database connectivity established
- JPA/Hibernate entity mapping
- Repository pattern implementation
- Data persistence verification

## Technical Skills Developed

| Skill Area | Technologies | Status |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Framework** | Spring Boot, Spring Web | Implemented |
| **Database** | MySQ | Implemented |
| **API Design** | REST, HTTP Methods | Functional |
| **Testing** | Postman, API Validation | Successful |
| **Build Tools** | Maven, Dependencies | Configured |

## Learning Approach

### **Practical Implementation**
- **Learning by doing** rather than just theory
- Building real, functional APIs that work
- Testing every endpoint to ensure functionality

### **Iterative Development**
- Starting with basic CRUD operations
- Gradually adding complexity and features
- Learning from both successes and challenges

### **Problem-Solving**
- Debugging API issues and database connections
- Understanding Spring Boot error messages
- Resolving configuration and dependency problems

## Current Status

### **Completed Successfully**
- Basic Spring Boot application setup
- Database configuration and connectivity
- Full CRUD API implementation in Book project
- Successful Postman testing of all endpoints
