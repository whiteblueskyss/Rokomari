# Java Study Plan

This file contains a step-by-step plan to revise and practice key Java concepts for your assignment and evaluation.

---

## 1. Classes & Objects
- Review class syntax, fields, and constructors
- Practice creating objects and accessing fields/methods
- Implement a simple class (e.g., Person or Book)

## 2. Methods
- Write methods with different access modifiers
- Practice method overloading
- Implement utility methods in your class

## 3. Mutable & Immutable Objects
- Review mutable vs. immutable concepts
- Implement a mutable class (e.g., Account)
- Implement an immutable class (e.g., Point)

## 4. Getter & Setter Methods
- Add private fields to a class
- Write getter and setter methods
- Practice using them to access and modify data

## 5. Exception Handling
- Review checked vs. unchecked exceptions
- Practice try-catch-finally blocks
- Create and use custom exception classes

## 6. Stream API
- Review basic Stream operations (filter, map, collect)
- Practice with lists and arrays
- Implement a few examples (e.g., filtering a list of objects)


## Tips
- Write small programs for each topic
- Use comments to explain your code
- Relate each concept to a real-world scenario
- Review and refactor your code after each step
