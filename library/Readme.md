# **Library Management API â€“ My Learning Journey**

## **My Goal**

I'm building a Library Management system to manage **Books, Authors, Reviews, and Users**. Basically I am learning spring boot by making thies APIs.

## **Phase 1: Setup & Basic CRUD**

Created two main entities:

- **Book**: `id, title, genre`
- **Author**: `id, name`

**What I have built:**

1. I have set up my Spring Boot project with necessary dependencies
2. I have created `BookRepository` and `AuthorRepository` using **JdbcTemplate**
3. I have implemented service and controller layers for both entities
4. I have built basic CRUD APIs:

   - `GET /books` - retrieve all books
   - `POST /books` - create a new book
   - `GET /books/{id}` - get a specific book
   - `PUT /books/{id}` - update a book
   - `DELETE /books/{id}` - delete a book.

   And same for authors.

   ***

**Phase 2: One-to-Many Relationship**
**Scenario:** A **Book** can have multiple **Reviews**.
**Entities:**

- Review: `id, book_id, user_id, rating, comment`

**Tasks:**

- Create `ReviewRepository`, service, and controller.
- Implement API to:

  - GET /api/reviews/book/{bookId} to get all reviews for a book
  - GET /api/reviews/{id} to get a review by ID
  - POST /api/reviews to add a new review
  - PUT /api/reviews/{id} to update a review
  - DELETE /api/reviews/{id} to delete a review

  **Goal:** Learn how to handle **child entities** and fetch related data.
